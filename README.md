# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 challenges. Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming puzzles that cover a variety of skill sets and skill levels and can be solved in any programming language you like.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

The event is created by Eric Wastl and is sponsored by many tech giants in the industry. It's a great way to improve your problem-solving skills and learn new programming concepts.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ Day01/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solution.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ input.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ Day02/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solution.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ input.txt
...
â””â”€â”€ Day25/
    â”œâ”€â”€ solution.py
    â””â”€â”€ input.txt
```

Each day's challenge is contained in its own directory, with a `solution.py` file containing the code and an `input.txt` file containing the puzzle input.

## Running the Solutions

To run a solution for a specific day:

1. Navigate to the day's directory
2. Run the solution script:

```bash
python solution.py
```

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

## Reflections

As I work through these challenges, I'm continually amazed by the creativity and complexity of the puzzles. Each day brings a new opportunity to learn and improve my coding skills. I've particularly enjoyed [you can add specific challenges or concepts you found interesting].
